# What is DocDocs?

DocDocs is a tool that enables developers to document their projects effortlessly by using their source code. It extracts the documentation using [TypeDoc](#) and generates a static site using [VitePress](#).

So DocDocs is not really needed for what you're currently reading, however, the [CLI Reference](/api/function/addnavlinktoviteuserconfig.html) on the other hand is what DocDocs is responsible for.

```ts
const x = true;
```

```shell
npm i @mekstuff/docdocs
```
